To enable USB host API support you should add a file named
android.hardware.usb.host.xml and containing the following lines:

<permissions>
  <feature name="android.hardware.usb.host"/>
</permissions>

into folder

/system/etc/permissions

in that folder find file named handheld_core_hardware.xml or
tablet_core_hardware.xml 

and add

<feature name="android.hardware.usb.host" />

into  <permissions> section

Reboot your device. Usb host api should work.
